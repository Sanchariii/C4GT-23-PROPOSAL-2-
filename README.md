# C4GT-23-PROPOSAL(2)

# SYNOPSIS:

Intelligent conversational agents known as chatbots have developed as useful information and aid providers in a variety of fields by simulating human-like interactions. An overview of the idea and features of chatbots is provided in this abstract, with special emphasis on how they might enhance user experience and automate activities. Natural language processing (NLP) techniques are used by chatbots to understand and interpret human input, allowing them to effectively respond and participate in meaningful discussions. As chatbot technology advances, the focus is shifting towards developing more sophisticated conversational agents that exhibit speech to text integration.

The proposed idea leverages Python, Elixir, Node.js, AI4Bharath REST API, System Design  technologies to enable the development of voice to text chatbot via AI4Bharath REST API. An new audio messaging and transcription software called audio to Text integration with Glific Chatbot was created to improve communication by smoothly fusing speech and text-based conversations. The platform seeks to give consumers a quick and easy way to communicate while getting over typing or language obstacles. The user should be able to interact with the application like a voice assistant and appropriate response will be returned by the application(through voice or text) via  AI4Bharath REST API.

With the help of this chatbot, users may send and receive audio notes through well-known messaging services like WhatsApp. The chatbot uses AI to transform voice notes into text messages using the AI4Bharath REST API, making it usable for users who prefer reading or have trouble understanding their native tongue. To accommodate customers who prefer spoken communication over text, the chatbot also offers the option to instantly convert text messages into audio notes. The implementation details have been discussed in the proposal using Scalable High-Level system Designs (HLDs) 

Keywords: Glific Chatbot, Voice to Text, REST API, Elixir , Node.js, python
